After internal discussions over years about creating a mobile app for our members, I created a prototype app with Xamarin Forms and built out push notification support using AWS SNS. I then expanded this prototype into our member app, and added features for member discussions, news, email brochures, and committee collaboration.

#### Technologies Used

* Xamarin Forms (Front-end)
* .NET (API)
* AWS SNS
