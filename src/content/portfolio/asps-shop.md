The new version of our online shop added a number of new features that staff had been clarmering for, including adding products to multiple categories, special automated categories (new products, education credit products, etc), and collection of additional information like meal choices as part of the check out process.

The previous version of our shop also had very deficient support for multiple SKUs. For example, each size and color of scrubs was listed as an entirely separate product. The new shop solved this by adding faceting support.
