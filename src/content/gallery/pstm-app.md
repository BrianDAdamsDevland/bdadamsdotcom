I designed and implemented support for our annual meeting into our existing member app. This involved both building a new front-end to display the conference schedule, speakers, and attendees, as well as an extensive new back-end to integrate with our AMS, registration vendor and exhibitor vendor to sync relevant data.

#### Technologies Used

* Xamarin Forms (Front-end)
* .NET (API)
* RDS SQL Server (Database)
* Lambda (API / Integrations)
