After many internal discussions for years about creating a mobile app for our members, I created a prototype app with Xamarin Forms and build out push notification support using AWS SNS. We then expanded this prototype into our member app, and added features for member discussions, news, email brochures, and committee collaboration.

#### Technologies Used

* Xamarin Forms (Front-end)
* .NET (API)
